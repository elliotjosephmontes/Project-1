# Project-1

This project investigates census and gun data to review various trends present in the US from 2012-2014. Included are various functions that read in a CSV file, extract data from specific columns, and count unique entries so further analysis can be performed. While only some columns were investigated, this project allows for further investigation using the code provided.

This project was performed with guidance from DataQuest.
